{"image_id": "counter_0_ready", "instruction": "Describe the updated board state just before starting the counter.", "expected_output": "The board is prepared for the first step of the counting process. One green ramp has been toggled, indicating the mechanism is primed. There are still 8 blue marbles at the top left and no red marbles. The setup represents the initial state of a binary counter, just before the first marble is dropped."}
{"image_id": "counter_1_start_corrected", "instruction": "Describe the board state as the first marble is released and highlight any improvements compared to the previous setup.", "expected_output": "The first blue marble has been released and is currently moving through the mechanism. The green ramps are now correctly configured for binary counting. Notably, the last ramp at the bottom, which was incorrectly oriented to the right in the previous setup, is now facing left \u2014 the correct direction for proper counting logic. This correction ensures the marble will follow the correct path and increment the counter as intended."}
{"image_id": "counter_0_setup", "instruction": "Describe the initial board setup before any marbles are released.", "expected_output": "The board is set up for a binary counter, but no marbles have been released yet. Several green ramps are placed in a diagonal layout. There are 8 blue marbles at the top left, ready to be dropped, and 0 red marbles. The mechanism is not yet active, and the goal is to begin the counting sequence from zero."}
{"image_id": "counter_1_after", "instruction": "Describe the board state after the first marble has completed the counting cycle.", "expected_output": "The first blue marble has completed its path through the binary counter, successfully toggling the ramps to represent the number 1. The bottom ramp is now toggled, indicating the first bit has changed. A new marble is positioned at the top left, ready to begin the next cycle. The configuration confirms that the counting mechanism works as expected."}
{"image_id": "counter_0_ready2", "instruction": "Describe the current board setup before starting the counter.", "expected_output": "The board is set up for the binary counter, with two green ramps now toggled in a diagonal layout. This indicates the mechanism is further primed compared to the previous state. The 8 blue marbles are still untouched, and the counter is ready to begin counting from 0 once the first marble is released."}
{"image_id": "counter_2_after", "instruction": "Describe the final board state after the second marble has completed the counting sequence.", "expected_output": "The second blue marble has successfully reached the bottom, completing the second counting operation. The green ramps now accurately represent the binary value 2 (10), with the first bit reset and the second bit toggled. All marbles have followed the intended path, and the counter is stable, showing the system functions correctly up to count 2."}
{"image_id": "counter_0_error_ramp", "instruction": "Describe the current board state and identify any setup mistakes.", "expected_output": "The board is configured for a binary counter, and most green ramps follow the intended diagonal layout. However, the last ramp at the bottom is incorrectly oriented to the right. This direction is inconsistent with the required left-leaning sequence for the counter to function correctly. If left as-is, this misaligned ramp could disrupt the ball's path and break the counting logic. No marbles have been released yet, and the setup needs to be fixed before execution."}
{"image_id": "counter_0_ready3", "instruction": "Describe the updated board state before starting the counter.", "expected_output": "The board is in the final stage of preparation for the binary counter. Several green ramps have been toggled, forming a diagonal sequence that reflects an initial binary setup. All 8 blue marbles are still in place at the top left, and no marbles have been released yet. This setup is ready for the first marble to begin the counting sequence."}
{"image_id": "counter_1_midway", "instruction": "Describe the board state as the first marble moves through the mechanism.", "expected_output": "Multiple blue marbles have been released, and one marble is currently passing through the lowest active ramp. The green ramps are correctly oriented for binary counting, and their toggled states represent the current binary value. This frame captures the counting process in progress, with the mechanism functioning as intended. The bottom ramp now correctly directs the marble in the leftward direction."}
