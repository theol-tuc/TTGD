{"image_id": "counter_2_midway", "instruction": "Describe the board state as the second marble is passing through the counter mechanism.", "expected_output": "The second blue marble is currently making its way through the binary counter. The ramp positions are updating in real-time to represent the binary transition from 1 to 2. One of the lower ramps is toggling again, and the second bit is about to be activated. This moment captures the internal switching process of the binary counter during the increment operation."}
